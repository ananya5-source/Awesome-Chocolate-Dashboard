1) Project title:

   Awesome chocolate Dashboard

2) Short description and purpose:

   This dashboard provides detailed insights into total amounts, profits, and other key metrics. Its purpose is to simplify data interpretation through visual elements such as bar graphs, pie charts, and more.
   
3) Tech stack (what tools I used) :

    Power BI Desktop – the main Data visualisation platform for report creation.
   
       Power Query – A Data transformation and cleaning platform used for report creation.
   
       DAX (Data Analysis Expression) – Used for calculating measures, dynamic visuals and conditional logic.
   
       Data Modelling – Used to establish relationships among tables.

5) Data source:
 
       This data is taken from GitHub.

5) Highlights/ features:

   This dashboard presents data including date, location, people, teams, products, shipments, and more. I utilised DAX formulas to create various measures such as Total Sales, Total Cost, Total Profit, Total Boxes, and Amount per Box, etc.
        I used an IF condition to create a line chart that compares total sales from the current year and the previous year. The dashboard also includes a treemap displaying the top 10 products (chocolates), created using filter options. Additionally, it presents shipment count by boxes. I calculated the profit percentage to visualise both total sales and profit margins of the product through a bar chart. A pie chart illustrates total sales by geographic region. The dashboard also highlights the top 5 salespeople, identified using filters based on total sales performance.
   To enhance interactivity, I added a slicer that allows users to filter and view data for a specific time period.
